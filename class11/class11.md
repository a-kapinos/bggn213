Today, we’ll be investigating protein structure.

## 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

Let’s start by downloading a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from
“Analyze” \> “PDB Statistics” \> “by Experimental Method and Molecular
Type”. We’ll move this CSV file into our project directory and load it
in using read.csv().

After assigning it to a variable, we’ll look at it’s structure using
head().

``` r
pdb.data <- read.csv("dataexportsummary.csv",row.names = 1)
head(pdb.data)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and
> Electron Microscopy.

``` r
x.ray <- round((sum(pdb.data$X.ray)/sum(pdb.data$Total)*100),2)

print(paste(x.ray,"% of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray"))
```

    ## [1] "87.53 % of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray"

``` r
e.m <- round((sum(pdb.data$EM)/sum(pdb.data$Total)*100),2)

print(paste(e.m,"% of structures in the PDB are solved by EM"))
```

    ## [1] "4.95 % of structures in the PDB are solved by EM"

What about doing this for all columns at once?

``` r
round(colSums(pdb.data)/sum(pdb.data$Total)*100,2)
```

    ##            X.ray              NMR               EM Multiple.methods 
    ##            87.53             7.36             4.95             0.11

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

``` r
prop.prot <- round(pdb.data$Total[1]/sum(pdb.data$Total)*100,2)

print(paste(prop.prot,"% of structures in the PDB are protein"))
```

    ## [1] "87.35 % of structures in the PDB are protein"

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and
> determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 1205 structures containing both the terms “HIV” and
“protease.”

## 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom
> per water molecule in this structure?

The single atom that we are seeing is the oxygen atom in the water
molecule. The resolution of the protein structure is at 2 Angstroms and,
in order to visualize hydrogen (which is quite small), we would need a
resolution of at least 1 Angstrom. Oxygen is large enough to be resolved
at this level.

> Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you
> identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water
> molecule have?

Yes, I can! The residue number is 308 (atom label is OH308:O).

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

Bio3D is an R package that we’ll be using for structural bioinformatics.
Let’s load Bio3D and read in a PDB file using read.pdb().

``` r
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hel")
```

    ##   Note: Accessing on-line PDB file

``` r
pdb
```

    ## 
    ##  Call:  read.pdb(file = "1hel")
    ## 
    ##    Total Models#: 1
    ##      Total Atoms#: 1186,  XYZs#: 3558  Chains#: 1  (values: A)
    ## 
    ##      Protein Atoms#: 1001  (residues/Calpha atoms#: 129)
    ##      Nucleic acid Atoms#: 0  (residues/phosphate atoms#: 0)
    ## 
    ##      Non-protein/nucleic Atoms#: 185  (residues: 185)
    ##      Non-protein/nucleic resid values: [ HOH (185) ]

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

There are 129 amino acid residues.

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

H0H, or water.

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

There is one protein chain (A).

Let’s use nma() for Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) a prediction of the
conformational variability and intrinsic dynamics of this protein.

``` r
m <- nma(pdb)
```

    ##  Diagonalizing Hessian...    Done in 0.249 seconds.

``` r
plot(m)
```

The mktrj() command makes a trajectory file that we can read into VMD
for viewing.

``` r
mktrj(m,file="nma.pdb")
```

Note: to view, use graphic presentation settings Tube and Index.
